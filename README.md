# California-Housing

	Created a supervised model that is trained on the California Housing Prices dataset to perform predictive analysis
	After data visualization and pre-processing, trained various models and selected one that performed the most optimally
	Fine-tuned the model by tuning the hyper-parameters 

Guidance and inspiration for this project came from Aurelion Geron's Fantastic Textbook Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow
