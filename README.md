# California-Housing

Guidance and inspiration for this project came from Aurelion Geron's Fantastic Textbook: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

Things I learned and experimented withL 

Creating a supervised model that is trained on the California Housing Prices dataset to perform predictive analysis
After data visualization and pre-processing, training various models and choosing one that performed the most optimally
Fine-tuning the model by tuning the hyper-parameters
